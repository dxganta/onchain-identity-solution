Just enter the address of any Sovryn staker in the search bar and click on the search button, and the dapp will output a list of the Proposals Created & the Proposals Voted by that address.

Note: The dapp is querying the events from this Sovryn governor address : 0xfF25f66b7D7F385503D70574AE0170b6B1622dAd
